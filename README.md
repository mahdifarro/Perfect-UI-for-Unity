## Requirements
Project is created with:
* Unity version: 2018.1+

## Setup
To use this template:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open project in Unity

3.1. Use UI canvas and its menu.

Or

3.2. You can design your own menu based on the template and put it in the UI manager script.

## Details
You can choose to rotate the screen by pressing the button or by rotating the device. Don't use both of them in the same build.
It doesn't work correctly, but I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
